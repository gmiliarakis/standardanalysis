\usage{
acat(pvals)

}
\value{
A single aggregated p-value (numeric).

\description{
The Aggregated Cauchy Association Test (ACAT), also known as the Cauchy Combination Test (CCT), combines p-values that may be arbitrarily dependent into a single aggregated p-value.
The test statistic is defined as a weighted sum of Cauchy transformations of individual p-values.
Under arbitrary dependency structures, the tail of the null distribution of the test statistic can be approximated by a Cauchy distribution, enabling p-value calculation.
